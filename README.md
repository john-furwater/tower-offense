# tower-offense
Tower Offense is a Tetris style game where players must build a tower out of descending shapes, as well as move a sliding canon attached to a rail next to their tower, attacking opponents towers and defending their own.  A notable difference from Tetris is that blocks do NOT disappear when you complete a solid line.
