# Tower Offense
Tower Offense is a Tetris style game where players must build a tower out of descending shapes, as well as move a sliding canon attached to a rail next to their tower, attacking opponents towers and defending their own.  A notable difference from Tetris is that blocks do NOT disappear when you complete a solid line.

Controls are as follows:

| ------------ |:--------:|:--------:|
| Move Up      | w        | o        |
| Move Down    | s        | l        |
| Rotate Left  | a        | k        |
| Rotate Right | d        | ;        |
| Fire Cannon  | e        | i        |

The longer you hold the `Fire Cannon` button down, the more velocity the cannonball will get shot with.  Once the button gets released, you must wait until the `Charge Bar` goes away before you can fire again.
