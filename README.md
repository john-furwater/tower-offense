# Tower Offense
Tower Offense is a Tetris style game where players must build a tower out of descending shapes, as well as move a sliding canon attached to a rail next to their tower, attacking opponents towers and defending their own.  A notable difference from Tetris is that blocks do NOT disappear when you complete a solid line.

### CannonScene
Controls are as follows:
- Up: 'w', up arrow, or joystick up axis
- Down: 's', down arrow, or joystick down axis
- Rotate clockwise: 'd', right arrow, or joystick right axis
- Rotate counter-clockwise: 'a', left arrow, or joystick left axis
- Fire: left-control, mouse left-click, or fire1 button

The longer you hold the button down, the more velocity the cannonball will get fired with.
